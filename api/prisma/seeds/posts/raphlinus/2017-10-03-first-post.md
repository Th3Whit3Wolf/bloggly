Hello. Iâ€™ve decided to start blogging again. Mostly I plan to write about my
various open-source projects, with occasional more personal things.

I expect this blog to be updated sporadically, and for much of the content to
be too abstruse to be interesting to a wide audience. That said, there will
probably be an occasional interesting or insightful nugget.

Thanks for reading.
